**How to install GumCP (simple way) which should work in most cases**

1. Login to your Raspberry Pi via ssh. 

    default username is: pi 
    
    default password is: raspberry
    
2. run this command:
```
cd && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install wget -y
```
3. run this command:
```
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gumslone/GumCP/master/installer.sh && sudo sh ./installer.sh

sudo apt-get install php-ssh2
```
restart apache:
```
sudo service apache2 restart
```
Get the wiringPi project using this commands:
```
cd
```
```
git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi
```
```
cd wiringPi
```
```
git pull origin
```
```
./build

```sudo git pull origin```

after update make sure to edit the **include/config.php** file

**If the actions.php or buttons.php page doesn't open or you get some http error, it means that php-ssh2 is not installed.**

For PHP 7 use this:

```sudo apt-get install php7.0-ssh2```

For PHP 7.1 use this:

```sudo apt-get install php7.1-ssh2```

Or try this command:

```sudo apt-get install php-ssh2```


**If your Raspberry Pi is accessible from internet**, you should tell the bots and spiders like googlebot not to crawl the pages of GumCP and exclude GumCP from search results with a robots.txt file.
Just create a file **robots.txt**, place it in the webroot of your raspberry pi (usually its /var/www/html/) and define in the robots.txt the parts of web content which shouldn't be crawled like this:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /GumCP/
```
which disallows access to GumCP folder

or

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
```
to exclude the entire web root from being crawled by bots

**TeHyBug module**

TeHyBug is a low power temperature/humidity and barometric air pressure wifi data tracker which can be ordered here: https://www.tindie.com/stores/gumslone/

The TeHyBug module requires sqlite3 to be installed:

```sudo apt-get install sqlite3```
